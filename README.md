## An App combining LLM and TTS
Caution! Poor English and poor programming skills!
# Simple introduction
This project is based on Ollama and GPT-SoVITS. It is not finished and might support ASR and other LLMs and TTSs in the future, which depends on how crazy I get. I hope it can be highly customized. UML is in the folder UML, but I made some changes while coding, so I can't ensure that the UML is right about everything.

# How to use
No way you want to use this shit! To be honest, I have no idea how it could work on other computers...
Currently, since it only supports Ollama and GPT-SoVITS, you have to have them prepared. Then you can edit the config.ini in the folder MyAiApp2. There aren't many choices at present. Don't blame me, please :(
I don't know if you have to import these shit into your VS 2022 or something like that. Maybe you can have a try. By the way, the main function is at MyAiApp2/modules/control/test.py

# PRs are not welcomed
This project sucks and never worth a single PR. I'm planning to change many parts of it... PRs might be welcomed after I'm satisfied with this shit.
